# Random-Number-Generator
This Python file contains a code to generate Random Numbers using Linear Congruential Method. 
Linear Congruential Method is a pseudo random generation algorithm.
This code also contains a cdf plot to visualize the random numbers generated.
Chi-square test is used to test the generator. Null Hypothesis is that the numbers follow iid Uniform (0,1) distribution. If Null Hypothesis is accepted then the generator
passes the test.
